Size Limit is a performance budget tool for JavaScript. It checks every commit on CI, calculates the real cost of your JS for end-users and throws an error if the cost exceeds the limit.

ES modules and tree-shaking support.
Add Size Limit to Travis CI, Circle CI, GitHub Actions or another CI system to know if a pull request adds a massive dependency.
Modular to fit different use cases: big JS applications that use their own bundler or small npm libraries with many files.
Can calculate the time it would take a browser to download and execute your JS. Time is a much more accurate and understandable metric compared to the size in bytes.
Calculations include all dependencies and polyfills used in your JS.
